# Tuning for FRC Dashboard
Addon for direct manipulation of individual NetworkTables values through FRC Dashboard.

## Installation
1. Copy the contents of `tuning.html` to wherever in the dashboard you desire (we recommend right underneath the camera).
2. Copy the contents of `tuning.css` to `style.css` in the dashboard. Of course, you can put it anywhere else you would normally put CSS.
3. Copy the sections of `tuning.js` to where the comments above each section say they should go.
